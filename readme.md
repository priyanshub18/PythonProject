Description:
        This Python project integrates speech recognition, translation, and sensor interfacing capabilities. It provides a versatile platform for interacting with various sensors while leveraging speech input for control and communication.

Features:
        Speech Recognition: Utilizes a speech recognition model to interpret voice commands for controlling sensors and initiating actions.
        Translation Model: Integrates a translation model to facilitate communication in multiple languages, enhancing accessibility and usability.
        Sensor Interfacing: Supports hardware connections for temperature sensors and ultrasonic sensors, enabling real-time data acquisition and analysis.
Installation:
    Clone Repository:
        git clone https://github.com/priyanshub18/PythonProject.git

    Install Dependencies:
        pip install -r installation.py
    Hardware Setup:
        Connect the temperature sensor and ultrasonic sensor to the appropriate GPIO pins or interfaces on your hardware platform.
    Configuration:
        Configure the necessary settings such as sensor calibration parameters, language preferences, and API keys (if applicable) in the config.py file.
Usage:
    Run the Application:
        python main.py
    Speech Input:
        Speak clearly and enunciate commands in the specified language.
        Supported commands may include sensor readings, language selection, and control actions.
    Translation:
        Specify the target language for translation, if needed, by speaking the corresponding language code or name.
    Sensor Readings:
        Retrieve temperature and distance measurements from the connected sensors by issuing appropriate commands.
    Control Actions:
        Perform specific actions based on voice commands, such as activating/deactivating sensors or initiating data logging.
